        Interactive Map
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Purpose
      </div>The purpose of the map interface is to query and explore water samples spatially. <div
        style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Creating a Query
      </div>
      1. Select at least one parameter. Type in the parameter box to start searching for a specific parameter name. You
      may select as many parameters as you wish.<br />
      2. The method menu is populated based on the parameters you selected. Therefore, you must select your
      parameters before your methods. Each parameter is linked to one or more methods, and you must select at least one
      method for every parameter you choose. <br>
      3. After selecting your parameter(s) and method(s), you have fulfilled your minimum requirements to create a
      query. At this point, you can select 'Create Map' and view your results. However, there are several additional
      options. Each of them will filter (limit) the returned results. For example, if you chose a date range of
      1980-2010 and a region of Lake Erie, each returned result must have been collected 1980-2010 AND in Lake Erie. Any
      field left blank will do nothing to filter/limit your returned results.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Year Slider: Only samples collected in the selected date range will be returned. Minimum and maximum dates on
          the
          slider will be included in the returned result. For example, a selection of 1990-2010 will return results from
          January 1, 1990-December 31, 2010.
        </li>
        <li>
          Region: Selecting a region will only return samples taken that region. The region menu is populated with
          regions
          designated in the GLRI database. Many samples in our database do not have a specified region, so use this
          option
          with caution.
        </li>
        <li>
          North/South/East/West: You may enter latitude and longitude values to create a bounding box for the returned
          data.
          Any latitude/longitude left blank will assume that you do not wish to place limits on that direction. For
          example,
          when all four options are left blank, we use North: 90, South -90, East: 180, West: -180 to
          query
          results. If you click 'Populate map bounds', the latitude/longitude boxes will be populated with the
          dimensions
          created by the bounding box of your screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimal satellite alignment: This is true/false field in our database.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include null values: Some samples in our database do not have results associated with them. Checking this box
          will include those samples in your returned results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      4. View your results by clicking 'Plot Points'. It is possible to create a query that does not return any results.
      If this happens, a popup will appear alerting you that there are no data associated with your query. Usually no
      data queries are due to entering a small bounding box or a date range that does not correspond with any samples in
      our database. <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Exploring Data
      </div>
      After you click 'Plot Points', yellow circles will appear on the map. The number on each circle corresponds with
      the number of
      filtered results there are in that approximate area. Click on a circle to zoom in and view a pop-up containing
      summary information for the results corresponding with that circle. The map will zoom in and will likely display
      several additional circles. Each of these circles are sub-sets of the circle you initially clicked on. You can
      also click and drag to move the map or
      use the scroll function on your mouse/touchpad to zoom.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Downloading Data
      </div>
      After you click 'Plot Points', the data download button will be enabled, allowing you to download a CSV of all
      your returned results. The data associated with this button is overwritten each time the 'Plot Points' button is
      clicked. Therefore, changing filters will do nothing to filter the data associated with this button until 'Plot
      Points' is selected.

        What is the goal of CyAN FIELD?
      </div>
      The goal of CyAN FIELD is to aid harmful algal bloom (HAB) research.
      <div style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">How does CyAN FIELD aid HAB research?</div>
      Users can query water quality samples and access the data through maps and scatter plots. The interactive graph
      allows users to flag and download data that need further investigation. By using these data as a ground-truth
      comparison, researchers create and validate HAB detection algorithms for spectral satellite data. <div
        style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px">
        Who uses CyAN FIELD?</div>
      Anyone can use CyAN FIELD. This app was custom-built for USGS, NASA, and EPA scientists and researchers who are
      studying HABs.
