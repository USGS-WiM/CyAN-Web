          Select at least one parameter. Type in the parameter box to start searching for a specific parameter name. You
          may select as many parameters as you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          The method menu is populated based on the parameters you selected. Therefore, you must select your
          parameters before your methods. Each parameter is linked to one or more methods, and you must select at least
          one
          method for every parameter you choose.
        </li>
        <li>After selecting your parameter(s) and method(s), you have fulfilled your minimum requirements to create a
          query. At this point, you can select <i>Create Map</i> and view your results. However, there are several
          additional
          options. Each of them will filter (limit) the returned results. For example, if you chose a date range of
          1980-2010 and a region of Lake Erie, each returned result must have been collected 1980-2010 AND in Lake Erie.
          Any

                dates on
                the
                slider will be included in the returned result. For example, a selection of 1990-2010 will return
                results
                from
                January 1, 1990-December 31, 2010.

              Region
              <ol>
                Selecting a region will only return samples taken that region. The region menu is populated
                with
                regions
                designated in the GLRI database. Many samples in our database do not have a specified region, so use
                this

                returned
                data.
                Any latitude/longitude left blank will assume that you do not wish to place limits on that direction.
                For
                example,
                when all four options are left blank, we use North: 90, South -90, East: 180, West: -180 to
                query
                results. If you click <i>Populate map bounds</i>, the latitude/longitude boxes will be populated with
                the
                dimensions
                created by the bounding box of your screen.

          View your results by clicking <i>Plot Points</i>. It is possible to create a query that does not return any

          If this happens, a popup will appear alerting you that there are no data associated with your query. Usually
          no
          data queries are due to entering a small bounding box or a date range that does not correspond with any
          samples in
          our database.

        summary information for the results corresponding with that circle. The map will zoom in and will likely display
        several additional circles. Each of these circles are sub-sets of the circle you initially clicked on. You can

        use the scroll function on your mouse/touchpad to zoom.

                  the y-axis, you have the option to record different flag types and annotations for each axis. If you

                  because the points you selected may have multiple different responses associated with

            When you click <i>Submit</i>, your new flags will be created. You will see this visually on the graph, with
            three
            different colors indicating which data are flagged (x-axis, y-axis, or both). If you generate a new graph
            that
            contains flagged data, those points will be displayed accordingly.

          You remove flags in the same way you create them. Every time you select data that are flagged, you overwrite
          the
          existing flag. Therefore, if you select points, leave both axes unchecked, and them click <i>Submit</i>, it
          is assumed you do not wish this point to be flagged, and the flag(s) and associated flag types and annotations
          are
          deleted. You can also remove all plotted flags at once by using the <i>Clear all plotted flags</i> button in
          the
          upper
          right-hand corner of the graph.

        Each parameter and method have a corresponding code. For example, <i>P400</i> corresponds with
        <i>Chlorophyta_Parapediastrum_count</i>. When it is reasonable, we spell out the full name, but there are
        instances in which we use the code to improve legibility. You may download tables containing the keys for
        parameter and
        methods codes here. We also use abbreviated names for the different flag types. For explanations of these flag
        types, download the <i>Flag Types</i> table.

        What is the goal of CyAN FIELD?
      </div>
      The goal of CyAN FIELD is to aid harmful algal bloom (HAB) research.
      <div style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">How does CyAN FIELD aid HAB research?</div>
      Users can query water quality samples and access the data through maps and scatter plots. The interactive graph
      allows users to flag and download data that need further investigation. By using these data as a ground-truth
      comparison, researchers create and validate HAB detection algorithms for spectral satellite data. <div
        style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px">
        Who uses CyAN FIELD?</div>
      Anyone can use CyAN FIELD. This app was custom-built for USGS, NASA, and EPA scientists and researchers who are
      studying HABs.<div style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px">
        Does CyAN FIELD have accessibility features?</div>We incorporated accessibility features and design to the best
      of our ability. However, we acknowledge that aspects of our app, particularly the interactive map and graph, are
      not accessible to all people. If you are unable to view and/or navigate the data plotted on our map and graph, we
      recommend downloading your queried data and opening it in your preferred spreadsheet editor (see our
      User's Guide for information on data downloads). If you benefit from a high-contrast visual layout, we recommend
      enabling this feature in your browser settings.
