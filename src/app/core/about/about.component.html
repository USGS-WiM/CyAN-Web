        Map
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Purpose
      </div>The purpose of the map interface is to query and explore water samples spatially. <div
        style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Creating a Query
      </div>
      1. Select at least one parameter. Type in the parameter box to start searching for a specific parameter name. You
      may select as many parameters as you wish.<br /><br />
      2. The method menu is populated based on the parameters you selected. Therefore, you must select your
      parameters before your methods. Each parameter is linked to one or more methods, and you must select at least one
      method for every parameter you choose. <br><br />
      3. After selecting your parameter(s) and method(s), you have fulfilled your minimum requirements to create a
      query. At this point, you can select 'Create Map' and view your results. However, there are several additional
      options. Each of them will filter (limit) the returned results. For example, if you chose a date range of
      1980-2010 and a region of Lake Erie, each returned result must have been collected 1980-2010 AND in Lake Erie. Any
      field left blank will do nothing to filter/limit your returned results.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Year Slider: Only samples collected in the selected date range will be returned. Minimum and maximum dates on
          the
          slider will be included in the returned result. For example, a selection of 1990-2010 will return results from
          January 1, 1990-December 31, 2010.
        </li>
        <li>
          Region: Selecting a region will only return samples taken that region. The region menu is populated with
          regions
          designated in the GLRI database. Many samples in our database do not have a specified region, so use this
          option
          with caution.
        </li>
        <li>
          North/South/East/West: You may enter latitude and longitude values to create a bounding box for the returned
          data.
          Any latitude/longitude left blank will assume that you do not wish to place limits on that direction. For
          example,
          when all four options are left blank, we use North: 90, South -90, East: 180, West: -180 to
          query
          results. If you click 'Populate map bounds', the latitude/longitude boxes will be populated with the
          dimensions
          created by the bounding box of your screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimal satellite alignment: Checking this box will only return samples with optimal satellite alignment. This
          is a true/false field in our database.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include null values: Some samples in our database do not have results associated with them. Checking this box
          will include those samples in your returned results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      4. View your results by clicking 'Plot Points'. It is possible to create a query that does not return any results.
      If this happens, a popup will appear alerting you that there are no data associated with your query. Usually no
      data queries are due to entering a small bounding box or a date range that does not correspond with any samples in
      our database. <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Exploring Data
      </div>
      After you click 'Plot Points', yellow circles will appear on the map. The number on each circle corresponds with
      the number of
      filtered results there are in that approximate area. Click on a circle to zoom in and view a pop-up containing
      summary information for the results corresponding with that circle. The map will zoom in and will likely display
      several additional circles. Each of these circles are sub-sets of the circle you initially clicked on. You can
      also click and drag to move the map or
      use the scroll function on your mouse/touchpad to zoom.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Downloading Data
      </div>
      After you click 'Plot Points', the data download button will be enabled, allowing you to download a CSV of all
      your returned results. The data associated with this button is overwritten each time the 'Plot Points' button is
      clicked (assuming your query returns data). Therefore, changing filters will do nothing to filter the data
      associated with this button until 'Plot
      Points' is selected. <br /><br />

        Graph
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Purpose
      </div>The primary purpose of the graph interface is to help identify outliers and other potential errors in the
      data.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Creating a Query
      </div>
      1. You are creating a scatter plot, so you must choose which values will be plotted on the x-axis and y-axis.
      First, select a parameter for the x-axis. Unlike in the map, you are limited to a single parameter because it is
      not possible to represent multiple units on the same axis. <br /><br />
      2. After selecting a parameter, the method menu will be populated with corresponding methods. Choose a method.
      Sometimes, a parameter will only have one corresponding method, in which case you must select the only available
      choice. <br /><br />
      3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for the y-axis. <br /><br />
      4. You have fulfilled the minimum requirements for creating a graph. You may now either click 'Create Graph',
      upload flags, or
      select additional options.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Uploading flags: If you downloaded your flags from a previous session and wish to use them now, click on the
          green 'Upload Flags' button. A box will open allowing you to select your file. Make sure that your file is
          saved
          as a CSV and that you didn't delete or add any fields since downloading the data. If you have multiple CSVs to
          upload, you must upload them one at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Year Slider: Only samples collected in the selected date range will be returned. Minimum and maximum dates on
          the
          slider will be included in the returned result. For example, a selection of 1990-2010 will return results from
          January 1, 1990-December 31, 2010. If you already found your desired date range while using the mapping
          filters, you may check 'Use date range from map options' to populate the slider with the selected values in
          the map options
        </li>
        <li>
          Log Scale: Checking x or y will apply a log scale to the corresponding axis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limit by study area specified in map option: Checking this box will add the region and latitude/longitude
          bounding box from the map filters menu to your query.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimal satellite alignment: Checking this box will only return samples with optimal satellite alignment. This
          is a true/false field in our database.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Generating a Graph
      </div>
      When you click 'Create Graph', a scatter plot will appear if your query returned data. In some instances, you
      might see a pop-up telling you that no data match your query or that your selected parameters and methods have no
      matching sites. In these cases, either your specified filters for one or both axes were too narrow, and no data
      were returned, or there
      were data returned, but there were no common sampling sites for which to match the data. For every
      plotted point, there is an x and y value. These values are paired based on the site ID.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Uploading Flags
      </div>
      If you uploaded a flag
      file prior to clicking 'Create Graph', those flags will be displayed in the graph (along with any new
      flags you have created in this session). If you uploaded your flags after clicking 'Create Graph', you must click
      it again to view your flags. Any filters or flags uploaded will not be applied to the graph until 'Create Graph'
      is clicked. These flags will be applied to all new graphs you generate throughout your session.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Creating Flags
      </div>
      1. Once you have successfully generated a graph, you are ready to create flags. There are three ways to create new
      flags.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flag an individual point: The 'Zoom' icon in the upper right corner of the plot doubles as a flag selector. If
          you click on a point while the Zoom icon is selected, you will be prompted to create a new flag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flag multiple points by using the lasso tool: The 'Lasso' icon in the upper right corner of the plot allows
          you to flag multiple points at once by clicking on the graph and dragging your cursor to create a shape around
          your desired selection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flag all plotted points: The 'Flag' icon in the upper right corner of the plot allows you to
          flag all plotted points at the same time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      If you select any points that are already flagged, they will be overwritten when you create new flags. <br /><br>
      2. After you select new point(s) to flag using any of the three methods listed above, you will need to record
      information about the flags you are creating.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select an axis: You will be prompted to check X-Axis and/or Y-Axis. Checking X-Axis will flag the data that is
          associated with the X-Axis of the scatter plot, while checking Y-Axis will flag the data associated with the
          Y-Axis. If you wish to flag both, check both boxes. Click 'Next'.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select flag types: You will be prompted to check flag type(s). There are six available options, and you may
          choose as many as you wish. If you don't want flag types associated with your new flag, leave all the boxes
          unchecked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notes: The 'Notes' section allows you to type in a custom flag type or any other notes you would like to save
          with your selected flag(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          Record different responses for y-axis data: If you chose to flag the data associated with both the x-axis and
          the y-axis, you have the option to record different flag types and annotations for each axis. If you check
          this box and then click 'Next', you will be prompted to enter different flag types/annotations for the y-axis.
          If you do not check this box and click 'Submit', your specified flag types and annotations will be applied to
          the data associated with both axes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cancel: If at any time you decide not to flag your selected data, click 'Cancel', and no new flags will be
          created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Previous selections: If you clicked on a single point that already has an associated flag, the options will be
          populated with your previous selections (axis, flag types, and annotations). Clicking on an individual point
          is a good way
          to review your previous work and make edits to a single point. If you choose to flag data through the lasso
          tool or by flagging all plotted data at once, you will not be able to see your previous selections. This is
          because the points you selected may have multiple different responses associated with
          them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      3. When you click 'Submit', your new flags will be created. You will see this visually on the graph, with three
      different colors indicating which data are flagged (x-axis, y-axis, or both). If you generate a new graph that
      contains flagged data, those points will be displayed accordingly.
      <div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Removing Flags
      </div>
      You remove flags in the same way you create them. Every time you select data that are flagged, you overwrite the
      existing flag. Therefore, if you select points, leave both axes unchecked, and them click 'Submit', it
      is assumed you do not wish this point to be flagged, and the flag(s) and associated flag types and annotations are
      deleted. You can also remove all plotted flags at once by using the 'Clear all plotted flags' button in the
      upper
      right-hand corner of the graph.<div style="font-size:medium; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
        Downloading Data
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flags: You save your work by downloading a CSV of your flags. Click the 'Download Flags' button (located next
          to the
          'Upload Flags' button) to download the CSV. Upload this file in your next session. If you uploaded CSV(s)
          during
          your current session, all these flags are included in your downloaded CSV, along with any new flags you
          created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Metadata: Clicking the 'Download Metadata' button will download two CSVs. One of them contains information
          associated with the query used to generate your graph. The other contains descriptions of flag types.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plotted Data: Clicking the 'Download all plotted data' button in the upper right-hand corner of the graph will
          download a CSV of the data associated with the plotted points. Clicking this button does not flag any data,
          nor does it contain any flag information associated with the flagged data.
        </li>
      </ul>

        What is the goal of CyAN FIELD?
      </div>
      The goal of CyAN FIELD is to aid harmful algal bloom (HAB) research.
      <div style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">How does CyAN FIELD aid HAB research?</div>
      Users can query water quality samples and access the data through maps and scatter plots. The interactive graph
      allows users to flag and download data that need further investigation. By using these data as a ground-truth
      comparison, researchers create and validate HAB detection algorithms for spectral satellite data. <div
