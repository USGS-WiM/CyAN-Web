        Creating a Query
      </div>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Select at least one parameter. Type in the parameter box to start searching for a specific parameter name. You
          may select as many parameters as you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          The method menu is populated based on the parameters you selected. Therefore, you must select your
          parameters before your methods. Each parameter is linked to one or more methods, and you must select at least
          one
          method for every parameter you choose.
        </li>
        <li>After selecting your parameter(s) and method(s), you have fulfilled your minimum requirements to create a
          query. At this point, you can select 'Create Map' and view your results. However, there are several additional
          options. Each of them will filter (limit) the returned results. For example, if you chose a date range of
          1980-2010 and a region of Lake Erie, each returned result must have been collected 1980-2010 AND in Lake Erie.
          Any
          field left blank will do nothing to filter/limit your returned results.<ul>

              Year Slider<br />

                maximum
                dates on
                the
                slider will be included in the returned result. For example, a selection of 1990-2010 will return
                results
                from
                January 1, 1990-December 31, 2010.

              Region
              <ol>
                Selecting a region will only return samples taken that region. The region menu is populated
                with
                regions
                designated in the GLRI database. Many samples in our database do not have a specified region, so use
                this
                option
                with caution.

                You may enter latitude and longitude values to create a bounding box for the
                returned
                data.
                Any latitude/longitude left blank will assume that you do not wish to place limits on that direction.
                For
                example,
                when all four options are left blank, we use North: 90, South -90, East: 180, West: -180 to
                query
                results. If you click 'Populate map bounds', the latitude/longitude boxes will be populated with the
                dimensions
                created by the bounding box of your screen.

                Checking
                this box
                will include those samples in your returned results.

        <li>
          View your results by clicking 'Plot Points'. It is possible to create a query that does not return any
          results.
          If this happens, a popup will appear alerting you that there are no data associated with your query. Usually
          no
          data queries are due to entering a small bounding box or a date range that does not correspond with any
          samples in
          our database.

        After you click 'Plot Points', yellow circles will appear on the map. The number on each circle corresponds with

        filtered results there are in that approximate area. Click on a circle to zoom in and view a pop-up containing
        summary information for the results corresponding with that circle. The map will zoom in and will likely display
        several additional circles. Each of these circles are sub-sets of the circle you initially clicked on. You can
        also click and drag to move the map or
        use the scroll function on your mouse/touchpad to zoom.

        your returned results. The data associated with this button is overwritten each time the 'Plot Points' button is
        clicked (assuming your query returns data). Therefore, changing filters will do nothing to filter the data

                The 'Zoom' icon in the upper right corner of the plot doubles as a flag

        What is the goal of CyAN FIELD?

      The goal of CyAN FIELD is to aid harmful algal bloom (HAB) research.
      <div style="font-size:large; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">How does CyAN FIELD aid HAB research?</div>
      Users can query water quality samples and access the data through maps and scatter plots. The interactive graph
      allows users to flag and download data that need further investigation. By using these data as a ground-truth
      comparison, researchers create and validate HAB detection algorithms for spectral satellite data. <div
